# ideabank
scratchbook of ideas I thought of, free for anyone to use and implement from
some are just ideas, some have fleshed out concepts - as I said, it's a sratchbook

## Food scanner - Scans the products and gives a health rating
- remember it's not about being against the companies, it's encouraging them to create healthier products
- make sure to open source the basis of calculation, not even the exact code but at least the methodology
- an idea I brainstormed with [https://github.com/Abhi78k](@Abhi78k)

See /food-health-rating folder for some more info / inspo

## If wattpad x readera had a baby with google docs's talent?
A social reading style app where user's can access their local files and choose to add a friend - they can see each other's comments on the books, reactions etc
- Make sure to checkout the legal aspect, and most probably make sure it says the responsiblity of the book's license / bought is on the user, aka it assumes they have legal rights
- ^^ Maybe, make it like the friend must have a local copy too, on the app's end - it's just maintaining state of progress of reading, comments etc from all the shared parties

See /read-with-friends folder for more info/ things to consider etc 

## email newsletter but within your friendcircle alone
What if you could create a newsletter but it's only shared within friends? snippets of what happened since previous letter or yada yada - [Letter Loop](https://www.letterloop.co/) is built off that idea but it's paid - I always thought it is a cool thing to replicate locally within the friend circle over a weekend, you don't have to ship it - maybe just built it for local use

check out the folder for more info - /letterloop

## flask-create
A good one if you know flask basics, a cli that creates a base scaffolding for a new project ( simialr to create-vue and create react cli's )
It has a base version already done under the folder, do `pip install -e .` to try out the current state

check out the folder for more info - /flask-create

## code-tidy
Find your giant functions and nested loops before they find you

A simple Python tool that spots the obvious code smells so you don't have to hunt through dozens of files looking for them.

#not an idea
Neocities - they describe themselves as "Neocities is a social network of 1,231,300 web sites that are bringing back the lost individual creativity of the web" 
basically really good set of really!! refreshing sites that make you nostalogic and think of 90-2k's websites in the sense
Cool gallery of sites to binge - [Neocities gallery](https://neocities.org/browse)

Maybe build one yourself? Admist all the shipping, visitors, resume value - let this be for yourself to go all out in however way you want
# who can implement this or use the ideas here?
This is an idea bank — a scratchbook of concepts, half-formed thoughts, and hopeful seeds.
You’re welcome to take anything here and run with it, remix it, or ignore it completely.
All I ask in exchange is:
- ✧ Please be kind to yourself.
- ✧ Take good rest.
- ✧ You don’t have to attribute me (unless you want to).

That’s it. Go make cool things. :>

I know some of these ideas are valuable. I know they could blow up, or be well funded. I know it may sound stupid to share but I dont care, to anyone who wants this idea - take it, just make sure to take good rest, be gentle and kind with yourself, sleep and eat well. You dont have to attribute me. If it succeeds, whether in funding, business or just in making you kinder, I am happy with that. I have someone I love with all of me and want to give all of my time to. Love the journey of building, while I love the journey of loving him 
With love,
His <33
