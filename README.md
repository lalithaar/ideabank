# ideabank
scratchbook of ideas I thought of, free for anyone to use and implement from
some are just ideas, some have fleshed out concepts - as I said, it's a sratchbook

## Food scanner - Scans the products and gives a health rating
- remember it's not about being against the companies, it's encouraging them to create healthier products
- make sure to open source the basis of calculation, not even the exact code but at least the methodology
## If wattpad x readera had a baby with google docs's talent?
A social reading style app where user's can access their local files and choose to add a friend - they can see each other's comments on the books, reactions etc
- Make sure to checkout the legal aspect, and most probably make sure it says the responsiblity of the book's license / bought is on the user, aka it assumes they have legal rights
- ^^ Maybe, make it like the friend must have a local copy too, on the app's end - it's just maintaining state of progress of reading, comments etc from all the shared parties

# who can implement this or use the ideas here?
This is an idea bank — a scratchbook of concepts, half-formed thoughts, and hopeful seeds.
You’re welcome to take anything here and run with it, remix it, or ignore it completely.
All I ask in exchange is:
✧ Please be kind to yourself.
✧ Take good rest.
✧ You don’t have to attribute me (unless you want to).

That’s it. Go make cool things. :>
