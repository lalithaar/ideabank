# ideabank
scratchbook of ideas I thought of, free for anyone to use and implement from
some are just ideas, some have fleshed out concepts - as I said, it's a sratchbook

## Food scanner - Scans the products and gives a health rating
- remember it's not about being against the companies, it's encouraging them to create healthier products
- make sure to open source the basis of calculation, not even the exact code but at least the methodology
## If wattpad x readera had a baby with google docs's talent?
A social reading style app where user's can access their local files and choose to add a friend - they can see each other's comments on the books, reactions etc
- Make sure to checkout the legal aspect, and most probably make sure it says the responsiblity of the book's license / bought is on the user, aka it assumes they have legal rights
- ^^ Maybe, make it like the friend must have a local copy too, on the app's end - it's just maintaining state of progress of reading, comments etc from all the shared parties
## anyone burnt out with tech shipping? check this out
#not an idea
Neocities - they describe themselves as "Neocities is a social network of 1,231,300 web sites that are bringing back the lost individual creativity of the web" 
basically really good set of really!! refreshing sites that make you nostalogic and think of 90-2k's websites in the sense
Cool gallery of sites to binge - [Neocities gallery](https://neocities.org/browse)

Maybe build one yourself? Admist all the shipping, visitors, resume value - let this be for yourself to go all out in however way you want
# who can implement this or use the ideas here?
This is an idea bank — a scratchbook of concepts, half-formed thoughts, and hopeful seeds.
You’re welcome to take anything here and run with it, remix it, or ignore it completely.
All I ask in exchange is:
- ✧ Please be kind to yourself.
- ✧ Take good rest.
- ✧ You don’t have to attribute me (unless you want to).

That’s it. Go make cool things. :>
