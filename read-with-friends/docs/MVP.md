# Notes
That’s a **smart MVP approach**—reducing infrastructure complexity while focusing on validating the **collaborative experience**. Here’s how it would work:  

### ✅ **MVP Architecture (Private, Local-Book Focused)**
- **Books Stored Locally**: No cloud storage, users open EPUB/PDF files from their own device.  
- **Annotations, Reactions, & Progress Synced to Server**: Store only the **metadata** (highlights, comments, and reading position).  
- **Friend Syncing via Room Codes**: Users create a reading session and invite friends to sync annotations.  
- **No DRM Issues**: Since the platform doesn’t host or distribute books, the legal responsibility remains with users (similar to ReadEra).  

### 🔥 **Advantages**  
1️⃣ **Faster Development** – No need for complex cloud storage & licensing issues.  
2️⃣ **Privacy-First** – Users retain full control over their files.  
3️⃣ **Easier to Market** – “Read any book with friends” without distribution concerns.  
4️⃣ **Monetization Potential** – Later introduce **social-powered book clubs & publisher partnerships**.  

### ⚠️ **Challenges & Solutions**
| **Challenge** | **Potential Solution** |
|--------------|-----------------------|
| Syncing Annotations Without Cloud Storage | Store annotations & reactions on a lightweight **PostgreSQL DB**, syncing via WebSockets. |
| Managing Different Book Versions | Use **hashed file signatures** to ensure users are annotating the same version. |
| Ensuring Smooth UX | Prefetch annotations from DB when a book is opened to avoid lag. |

This approach lets you **test core interactions without licensing issues**, while **ensuring scalability later** when expanding to **cloud-hosted** or **publisher-backed** books. 🚀

🎯 **Next Steps:**
1️⃣ Finalize MVP feature list ✅  
2️⃣ Set up repo & development plan ✅  
3️⃣ Recruit beta testers 🎯
